# goal 

create a CRUD app that allows users to select and import the JSON file to sqlite
and allows user to perform CRUD operations in an HTML interface

# soft requirements
I used github copilot a lot!


# some mechanics

pipreqs --encoding utf-8 "./"

---
lots of debugging to get the app started. chatgit hubpilot doesn't wirte the best code out of the box.

Made huge progress over the course of 90 non-sequential minutes.

very much an ETL process as well!
