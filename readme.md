done: convert text to json


goal 

create a CRUD app that allows users to select and import the JSON file to sqlite
and allows user to perform CRUD operations in an HTML interface

pipreqs --encoding utf-8 "./"

lots of debugging to get the app started. chatgit hub doesn't wirte the best code out of the box.

made huge progress!

very much an ETL process as well!

having trouble getting the database created!
