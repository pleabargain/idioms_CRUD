* js goes inside the BODY tag! doh!

* as soon as I wanted to demonstrate the app, it failed! OFC!

* lots of debugging to get the app started. 

* chatgit hubpilot doesn't wirte the best code out of the box.

* Flask secret key was a real pain

* Made huge progress over the course of 90 non-sequential minutes.

* Initially it was very much an ETL process!
