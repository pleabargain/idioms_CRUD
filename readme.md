Fixing what I broke!


# goal 

create a CRUD app that allows users to select and import the JSON file to sqlite
and allows user to perform CRUD operations in an HTML interface

# soft requirements

I used github copilot a lot! And I mean a lot!


# some mechanics

```

pipreqs --encoding utf-8 "./"


```



---
* js goes inside the BODY tag! doh!

* as soon as I wanted to demonstrate the app, it failed! OFC!

* lots of debugging to get the app started. 

* chatgit hubpilot doesn't wirte the best code out of the box.

* Flask secret key was a real pain

* Made huge progress over the course of 90 non-sequential minutes.

* Initially it was very much an ETL process!

# to do
* verify edit.html writes to the DB
* Clean up the UI
* * confirm to user that a new item has been added
* add user log in and authorization

# Done
done: convert text to json
done: having trouble getting the database created!
done: added more error correction
done: added a basic CSS
